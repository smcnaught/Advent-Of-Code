 * 
 * *** Description: ***
 * Depth-first search is a common way that many people naturally use when solving problems like mazes.
 * First, we select a path in the maze and we follow it until we hit a dead end or reach the end of the maze.
 * If a given path doesnâ€™t work, we backtrack and take an alternative path from a past junction, and try that path.
 * 
 * 
 * *** Differences between Breadth First and Depth First ***
 *  -BFS algorithm starts shallow and digs deeper row by row. 
 *  -DFS on the other hand quickly dives deep into the structure you are searching, 
 *   quickly reaching the bottom and then working its way back up to the top.
 * 
 *  -If a solution is not far from the root of the tree it would be obvious to use BFS 
 *   since it quickly searches the top of the data structure first. 
 *   However, if your solution could be deep inside the data structure, a DFS algorithm 
 *   would dive quickly down in search of it. Also, in the case of wide trees a DFS search
 *   is more effective while a narrow tree is easily traversed by a BFS search.
