# Advent-Of-Code
Thanks to [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz) for creating [Advent-Of-Code](https://adventofcode.com/)!

## Description
Advent-Of-Code is an advent calendar of programming puzzles that's released yearly. Each puzzle is truly unique and challenging in its own way. Not only have these puzzles helped me become a better programmer, but they've also helped me become a better problem solver. I would recommend Advent-Of-Code to anyone looking to better their skills or anyone who simply enjoys a good puzzle.

## Usage
To test any solution with your own input, create an input.txt file in the same folder
and paste in your puzzle input. Then run the code via node.

## Create Files for New Year
The `create-files-for-next-year.js` script can be run to create the files for a new year of puzzles. Just change the `nextYear` variable to the year you want to create and run the script with node in the terminal.
